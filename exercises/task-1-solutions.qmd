## About Lemurs

The [Duke Lemur Center](https://lemur.duke.edu/) houses over 200 lemurs and bushbabies across 13 species -- the most diverse population of lemurs on Earth, outside their native Madagascar.

Lemurs are the most threatened group of mammals on the planet, and 95% of lemur species are at risk of extinction.
